# Project: Component Creator

## Overview

This script is designed to create a directory structure for a React component. It generates folders and files following a predefined boilerplate for the component.

The main script, `createComponent.sh`, takes a component name as an argument and creates the necessary files and folders.

## How to Use

To use the script, simply run the `createComponent.sh` script with the component name as an argument:

```markdown
bash sh createComponent.sh MyComponent
```

_Replace `MyComponent` with the name of your desired component. The script will generate the folder structure and files for the component._

## Help

You can use the `-h` or `--help` option to display the help message:

```markdown
sh createComponent.sh -h
```

## Requirements

- Bash shell (Unix-like operating system)
